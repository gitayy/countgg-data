countgg-data

# Instructions
---
These files are gzipped to save significant space and abide by github's filesize limit, use a tool like 7zip to unzip them. 

Some information is removed, like comments, so that I'm not publicly storing information users should be able to delete freely

Data is subject to change randomly lol, there is a known issue with validCountNumber resetting in resetOnMistakes threads for instance which I'll fix eventually. Or if an invalid count is accidentally let through and I have to fix it later.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out!
